      Hi! I'm Emre Otay. I am currently studying Computer Science at Rose-Hulman
      .In this page you can find information about me!
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time i like to play video games, go alpine skiing, or sky-diving(haven't done it yet but its seems this
      is something cool to say and would love to do it sometime).
      Since I am studying currently... video games is ussualy one to go :(
    </p>

      One of my interest and academic goal is to do a Robotics Minor hence learn more about the field and hopefully one
      day become a Robotics Software Development
      Engineer. I really like robots and automation, hence this is kinda like the dream for me!
    </p>

      If anyone is interested in what type of games I play, they are League of Legends, World of Warcraft (no longer
      playing RIP feral PVP) , and Fortnite.
